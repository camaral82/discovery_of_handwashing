# discovery_of_handwashing
Project Description 

In 1847, the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis made a breakthough discovery:he discovers handwashing. 
Contaminated hands was a major cause of childbed fever and by enforcing handwashing at his hospital he saved hundreds of lives.

In this R project we will reanalyze the medical data Semmelweis collected, 
manipulating data frames using dplyr and making simple plots using ggplot2.
